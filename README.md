This is a power bi dashboard that was created with a dataset (used cars dataset) to get an general overview about the used cars in the dataset. 
The sole pursose was to get a broad insight about the dataset. Visualization tools that were adapted in this dashboard include a donut chart, a card, 
a tree map, an area chart and a clustered bar chart.
